# UM Eats
An app to find healthy food on the University of Miami campus.

## Construction

The cross-platform app was built using lightweight components -- Angular, Framework7, Cordova, and simple front-end json storage. Some components were based off of https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Pure-Angular-Template.
